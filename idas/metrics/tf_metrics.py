    of two batch of data, usually be used for binary image segmentation
    i.e. labels are binary. The coefficient between 0 to 1, 1 means totally match.

    Parameters
    -----------
    output : Tensor
        A distribution with shape: [batch_size, ....], (any dimensions).
    target : Tensor
        The target distribution, format the same with `output`.
    axis : tuple of int
        All dimensions are reduced, default ``[1,2,3]``.
    smooth : float
        This small value will be added to the numerator and denominator.

    Examples
    ---------
    '>>> outputs = tl.act.pixel_wise_softmax(network.outputs)'
    '>>> dice_loss = 1 - dice_coe(outputs, y_)'
